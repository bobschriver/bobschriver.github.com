<h1> Infrasonics </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
Infrasonics, much like is counterpart ultrasonics, deals in the realm of sound outside the range of human hearing. More specifically, infrasonics deals with frequencies from 0-20Hz, and the majority of this spectrum is below the hearing of even the most adept human being. Much like ultrasonics there is a multitude of applications in the scientific and engineering realms of infrasound, however the study of infrasound itself and its affects on people and other organisms is much less researched than ultrasound and its affect on the biological world. However, the studies that have been conducted reveal very curious affects which infrasound has on the human body and mind, and has certainly piqued my curiousity into the generation and use of infrasound.

<h2> Unintentional Sources of Infrasound </h2>

<h3> Artificial </h3>

<p>
Despite the fact that most commercial speaker systems have trouble generating adequate responses for sound in the infrasonic range, we are nevertheless innundated with infrasound in our day to day life. Basically any large piece of machinery creates vibrations in the infrasound range, diesel motors probably being the most prevalent. Any space in which these large machines are confined are basically infrasound traps, so factories, submarines, jet engines etc. can have high intensity infrasonic waves within them. In fact, you may have accidently stumbled upon infrasound when driving down the highway. At high speeds with your window open, your car act similarly to a low frequency <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance'>Helmholtz Resonator</a>, which causes the irritating low buzz from around 10-40Hz.

<h3> Natural </h3>

<p>
Infrasound is far from an artifical problem, however, and there are many sources of infrasound which are generated by natural events. Natural distasters in particular are huge generators of infrasound; hurricanes, earthquake and tornadoes all produce sound from 7-12Hz. Some scientists speculate this is how animals know that a natural disaster is going to occur and scurry to higher ground, and is the basis for some theories why infrasound can have a porfound affect on people.

<h2> Physiological and Psychological impact of Infrasound </h2>

<p>
The most interesting ideas surround infrasound are not really about the natural and artificial source. Rather, the debate on the extent and reason behind infrasounds affect on humans compells us truly understand infrasound. There are two basic ways which sound waves of any type can affect us, one is psychological, that is how us perceiving the wave affects our emotional and psychological state, and physiological, that is how these sound waves interact with our body and cause us discomfort or pleasure. Due to the complex interactions between sounds and our bodies, these two aren't as easy to seperate as you might imagine. The physiological aspects of infrasound deal mostly with the fact that structures within our body resonate naturally at low frequencies, thus when playing an infrasonic tone this resonance can cause unnatural vibrations. For example, the USAF performed a study which found that their jet planes created frequencies ~18Hz which is around the resonant frequency of the human eye. Thus, some pilots were reporting headaches and visual ghosting due to the brain trying to account for eye movement which it did not cause.

<p>
The psychological aspects of infrasound can range from none whatsoever to extreme discomfort and annoyance. There is no universally accepted reason for a psychological response to sound which we cannot even hear, however some explanation include a response similar to animals before a natural disaster, or as a response to physiological affects, like the vibration of the inner ear which can lead to nausea and a feeling of falling.  
</p>

<p>
The interesting point, no matter what the cause, is that there are sound which we cannot conciously percieve but which can still have a profound affect upon us.
