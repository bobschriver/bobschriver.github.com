<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=46785">Cylon Eye</a>  is a <a href=http://csh.rit.edu/">CSH</a> project which is a series of modular LED displays. The purpose of the web app is to provide a method for people to create animations to be pushed to the actual displays. The app is based off of Javascript and allows users to enter and simulate potential animations and then send them to a server to be parsed and sent on to the LED panels.
