### Infrasonics ###

## Introduction ##

Infrasonics, much like is counterpart ultrasonics, deals in the realm of sound outside the range of human hearing. More specifically, infrasonics deals with frequencies from 0-20Hz, and the majority of this spectrum is below the hearing of even the most adept human being. Much like ultrasonics there is a multitude of applications in the scientific and engineering realms of infrasound, however the study of infrasound itself and its affects on people and other organisms is much less researched than ultrasound and its affect on the biological world. However, the studies that have been conducted reveal very curious affects which infrasound has on the human body and mind, and has certainly piqued my curiousity into the generation and use of infrasound.

## Unintentional Sources of Infrasound ##

Despite the fact that most commercial speaker systems have trouble generating adequate responses for sound in the infrasonic range, we are nevertheless innundated with infrasound in our day to day life. Basically any large piece of machinery creates vibrations in the infrasound range, diesel motors probably being the most prevalent. Any space in which these large machines are confined are basically infrasound traps, so factories, submarines, jet engines etc. can have high intensity infrasonic waves within them. In fact, you may have accidently stumbled upon infrasound when driving down the highway. At high speeds with your window open, your car act similarly to a low frequency [Helmholz Resonator][helmholtz], which causes the irritating low buzz from around 10-40Hz.
