<h2> Introduction to Digital Image Processing </h2>

<p>
This was a presentation I gave which covers the basis of Digital Image Processing to an audience with a programming background. Topics covered include analog to digital conversion, the Fourier transform, convolution, blurring and noise reduction, edge detection, interpolation, histograms, thresholding, and JPEG compression. Included are MATLAB code demos for most of these topics
