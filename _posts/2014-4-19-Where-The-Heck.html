<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
This project stemmed from a desire to figure out where to live in Seattle. I wanted a place with good access to grocery stores, restaurants, public transit, and cheap housing. Since all of this information is publically availible (ish...Lookin' at you craigslist), I thought I could aggregate all of this data into a heatmap. Also important was the ability to weigh things you find important, for example I care a lot about good transit and produce stands, but not at all about bars. This project can be viewed as a sort of reverse <a href="http://walkscore.com">Walkscore</a>, but which also selects and weighs businesses and transit more intelligently, as well as includes apartment cost data

I've made what I think is a good first stab at the problem, and you can see the heatmap of Seattle tailored for me below

This project is written in a combination of Ruby and Python, with most of the scrapers/parsers in Ruby and the heatmap generation in Python. You can view the source <a href="https://github.com/bobschriver/wheretheheck">here</a>
