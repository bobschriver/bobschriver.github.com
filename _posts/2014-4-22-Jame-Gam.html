<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
Jame Gam was written for a 24-hour Game Jam, and was intended to be a sort of musical exploration game. The intention was to collect a group of blocks that matched a given tone sequence. This didn't quite work, and it ended up as more of a trippy pastel dungeon crawler game with no point. I'm quite happy with it.

<h2> Results </h2>

<p>
You can view <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~schriver/game_jam/">Jame Gam here</a>, it only works in the latest version of Chrome due to HTML5 issues.

<h2> Source </h2>

<p>
Jame Gam was a learning project, and is written in HTML5 (including the HTML5 audio API), and Javascript. The code is ... not great, but you can look at it <a href="https://github.com/bobschriver/Jame-Gam">here</a>
