<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
The purpose of this project was to explore the use of camera phones with flash as a distributed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_Incapacitator">LED Incapacitator</a>. While most camera phone flashes are only one color and lack the ability to modify their intensity, a closely clustered group of phones with strobing LED's should have a similar effect as an actual weapon. At the very least, single camera phone flashes should be able to take advantage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucha_effect">Bucha Effect</a> and so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_vertigo">Flicker Vertigo</a>.

<h2> Results </h2>

<p>
The project is as of now unfinished. However I am specifically interested in measuring the disorientation caused by a camera phone flash strobing in the frequencies of 10-15 Hz, as well as different durations of the flash being active. If one phone or multiple phones working independently create a significant decrease in concentration and focusing, then a distributed app based on bluetooth synching of frequencies will be created.
