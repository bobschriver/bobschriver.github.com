<p>
Some theoretical basis of One Line Music are documented <a href="http://countercomplex.blogspot.com/2011/10/some-deep-analysis-of-one-line-music.html">here</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1368">here</a>.

The program still has some issues, like a non-optimal fitness function, and a lack of one to one correspondence between my output and putchar()'s output, however the program still creates interesting an non-intuitive patterns.
