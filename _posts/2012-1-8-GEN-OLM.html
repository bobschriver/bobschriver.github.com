<p>
The purpose of this project was to create a genetic algorithm for the creation of One Line Music, also known as "bytebeat" music. Some examples of human generated One Line Music are shown in this video.

Some theoretical basis of One Line Music are documented <a href="http://countercomplex.blogspot.com/2011/10/some-deep-analysis-of-one-line-music.html">here</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1368">here</a>

The program still has some issues, like a non-optimal fitness function, and a lack of one to one correspondence between my output and putchar()'s output, however the program still creates interesting an non-intuitive patterns
