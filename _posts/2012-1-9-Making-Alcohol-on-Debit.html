<h2> Making Alcohol on Debit</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this presentation is to demonstrate making alcohol on <a href="http://finweb.rit.edu/diningservices/mealplans/">RIT Debit</a>. More specifically, the presentation describes vinting, or making wine, using only tools and ingredients that can be purchased on an RIT Meal Plan. Legal Statutes on home winemaking vary from region to region, so consult your local laws before doing anything.
