## Introduction ##

Jame Gam was written for a 24-hour Game Jam, and was intended to be a sort of musical exploration game. The intention was to collect a group of blocks that matched a given tone sequence. This didn't quite work, and it ended up as more of a trippy pastel dungeon crawler game with no point. I'm quite happy with it.

## Source ##

Jame Gam was written in HTML5 (including the HTML5 audio API), and Javascript. Considering that this was a learning project (I was unfamiliar with Javascript when starting, and HTML5 was still very beta), the code is ... not great.
